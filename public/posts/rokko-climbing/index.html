<p>There are several small parking lots around Ashiyagawa Sta. but some of those was full. It was a little hard to find one in the late morning.</p>

<p>30 min. walk from the station to the entrance of Rock Garden through residential area. The signboard helps to find the route.</p>

<h2 id="rock-garden">Rock Garden</h2>
<p>Walked for a while after passing the residential area, we arrived the entrance of Rock Garden. It looks like an entrance of an amusemen park but no one was there. We had a short rest then just passed it.</p>

<p>Rock garden is a good place to have an experience of rock climbing for beginners. It is not far from the station and the residential place. Just three and a half hours takes you a short and interesting place.</p>
