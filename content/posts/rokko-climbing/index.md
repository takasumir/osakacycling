June is a rany season in most parts of Japan. It was a happy sunny holiday when I decided to climb "Rock Garden" in Mt. Rokko with my family. Contrary to its name, Rock Garden, climbing the route is easy and fun. Recommended for kids and families.

Rock Garden is North of the station. We went through under the overpass.

30 min. walk from the station to the entrance of Rock Garden through residential area. The signboard helps to find the route.

There are large houses rich people may be living in.

## Rock Garden

Walked for a while after passing the residential area, we arrived the entrance of Rock Garden. It looks like an entrance of an amusemen park but no one was there. We had a short rest then just passed it.

It says "cafe" but it looks closed and left for a long time.

There is a small waterfall just after the entrance. Chlidren were playing there.

Rock climbing starts here. You don't need any special rock climbing equipment.

My dauter, 3 years old, tried even harder!

A lot of people were climbing in a line.

The place was clouded with people. The view from here is not so good. It is still in the middle of Rokko mountain but we were satisfied after the funny climbing.

My kids slided down from the rock.

There is a rock called Flog Rock. Does its shape look like a flog??

## Egenoyama Ruins

People were resting in a open space. This is Egenoyama Ruins. 

![Open_space](images/IMG_20210606_140212.webp)

Vestiges of ancient residences, graves, ritual places and so on from 2000 years ago were found.

After passing the ruins, we arrived the gate at which mountain trail ends.

Everybody was so tired that they sit or lie on the road!

Walked down in the residential area looking for a vending machine but we hadn't found one.

This travel ends at Ashiyagawa Sta. Finally we got drinks at a convenience store.
